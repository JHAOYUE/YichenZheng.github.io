    <blockquote><p>

    Sonnet by Shakespeare <br>
    <br>
    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate: <br>
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, <br>
    And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br>
    </p></blockquote>

  
  
      
  <!--   Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
    And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; 
    And every fair from fair sometime declines, 
    By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd  
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade 
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; 
    Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, 
    When in eternal lines to time thou growest:  
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, 
    So long lives this and this gives life to thee.  -->
